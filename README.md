<h1> Madison-Island Aautomation Project</h1>
This is my first automation project with Java and Selenium, developed for a demo site: https://madison-island.com/ <br>
Further details can be found on the following website: __

<h2> Overview </h2>
I implemented the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern by organizing the project into 'Page' and 'Test' classes, where each web page is represented by its own corresponding class. <br>
Additionally, I designed the methods to be reusable and flexible, ensuring they can easily accommodate new features as the application evolves.
